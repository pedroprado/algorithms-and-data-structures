//Basically, it as function that calls itself

//It is a cleaner solution for some functions

//Callstack
//Normal functions: functions being called are add to the top of the stack (PUSHDE) a they only come out (POP) when it returns a value
//Recursive functions: keep pushing new functions to the callstack!!

//GAME PLAN (how recursive functions work)

//Invoke the same functions with DIFFERENT INPUT until you reach the BASE CASE
//***BASE CASE: END OF THE LINE. A condition where the Recursion Stops */

//Essencials of Recursions: BASE CASE and DIFFERENT INPUTS
//Do not forget to return in the BASE CASE
//Do not forget to return the recursive call (with diferent input)
