Problem Solving
1.Undestand
    - Inputs, Outputs, contraints and Edge Cases, operations to be used
2.Explore
    - Use concrete examples to drive the solution (ex: Unit Tests)
    - Explore the scenarios; edge cases, empty inputs, normal inputs, invalid inputs
3.Break it down
    - Write the steps you need to accomplish
4.Solve/Simplify
    - Problems that we dont know -> temporally simplify (solve a simpler problem)
    - Solving a simpler problem can give you insight on how to solve harder
5.Refactor
    - Look back and improve the code!
    - Improve: perfomance and stylistic ( for better and shorter reading)
